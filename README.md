# QnA Application
Application used during QnA session of Youth Timothy's Service of GPdI Singapore which will be held on 1st Oct 2016.
The application skeleton was created in June 2016, but modified and enhanced this week 26-27 Sept 2016 during my spare times.

Framework stacks:
- UI: jQuery Mobile
- Backend: Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Web MVC and RESTful. These are part of Spring Boot Starter Libs. Refer to the pom.xml file for more info.
- DB: MongoDB


Further documentation will be provided.. stay tuned!!

Thanks!
